The SCU AE Title is now uppercase MONAISCU. Updates fo-dicom to 5.0.3 Defaults temporary storage to use disk with ability to switch to memory. 0.3.0 GitHub Milestone 0.3.0 Adds a basic FHIR service to accept any versions of FHIR. Updates Health Check API to replace /health/live and /health/ready APIs with /health API. 0.2.0 GitHub Milestone 0.2.0 Adds DICOMWeb STOW-RS service to enable triggering of workflow requests via DICOMWeb standard. Adds HL7 (MLLP) service to enable triggering of workflow requests using HL7 messages. Breaking changes with how Informatics Gateway handles incoming data and uploading to the storage service. All incoming data are now immediately queued for upload to the storage service instead of saving to the local disk. Therefore, if Informatics Gateway restarts or crashes during upload, any queued or incomplete uploads are lost. In addition, during the Informatics Gateway startup, the payload assembly service removes any payloads containing any pending files. Files that were successfully uploaded to the temporary location ( storage>temporary ) in the bucket ( storage>temporaryBucketName ) are then moved to the payload bucket ( storage>bucketName ) before sending a workflow request. Breaking changes in the storage configuration to allow dynamic key-value pairs. Breaking changes to enable dynamic loading of the storage & the messaging libraries. 0.1.1 GitHub Milestone 0.1.1 User guide updates & minor bug fixes. The MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway upgrades the existing NVIDIA Clara Deploy DICOM Adapter to provide additional features and integrate with the MONAI Deploy platform. DICOM SCP (C-ECHO & C-STORE), SCU (C-STORE) support ACR API with ability to retrieve data via DICOMweb & FHIR Integrates with MinIO as the default storage service for storing received/retrieve data and for sharing among other subsystems in MONAI Deploy platform. Integrates with RabbitMQ as the default messaging broker for exchanging requests among other subsystems. For a complete list of supported features, pleas refer to the User Guide ."

Users implementing the MONAI Deploy SDK must update their DICOM Conformance Statement according to the actual capabilities of their application. DICOM SCP The DICOM SCP service implements C-ECHO and C-Store services to interface with other medical devices, such as PACS. It allows users to define multiple AE Titles to enable DICOM communication. It then maps each AE Title to a pipeline. DIMSE Services (SCP) C-STORE : Accepts incoming DICOM objects C-ECHO : Accepts incoming DICOM verification requests SOP Classes (Transfer) and Transfer Syntax Supported The DICOM SCP service accepts any proposed transfer syntaxes and stores any accepted instances, as-is, on disk without any decoding support. Association Policies DICOM Storage SCP accepts associations but does not initiate associations. DICOM Storage SCP accepts up to 1000 (default: 25 ) simultaneous associations across all configured AE Titles. DICOM Storage SCP accepts associations when storage space usage is less than the configured watermark (default: 75% of the storage partition) and the available storage space is above the configured reserved storage size (default: 5GB of free space). Asynchronous mode is not supported. Instead, all operations are performed synchronously. The Implementation Class UID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8 and the Implementation Version Name is fo-dicom 4.x.x . An association must be released properly for received instances to be associated with a pipeline. Files received from an aborted association or an interrupted connection are either removed immediately or removed based on a configured timeout value. Security Profiles MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway Storage SCP does not conform to any defined DICOM Security Profiles. Therefore, the product is assumed to be used within a secure environment with a firewall, router protection, VPN, and other network security provisions. Users may configure the DICOM Storage SCP service to check the following DICOM values when determining whether to accept Association Open Requests: Calling (source) AE Title: To accept DICOM instances from known sources. Called (MONAI SCP) AE Title: To accept DICOM instance through configured MONAI AETs. DICOM SCU The DICOM Storage SCU provides the DICOM Storage Service for interfacing with other medical devices such as PACS. It is executed at system startup and exists in a container using a single configurable AE Title. DIMSE Services (SCU) C-STORE : Sends user-generated DICOM results to configured destinations. The DICOM Storage SCU initiates a push of DICOM objects to the Remote DICOM Storage SCP. The system allows multiple remote SCPs to be configured. SOP Classes (Transfer) Supported and Transfer Syntax The DICOM Store SCU service supports all SOP Classes of the Storage Service Class. The DICOM Store SCU service transfers a DICOM object as-is using the stored Transfer Syntax, without the support of compression, decompression, or Transfer Syntax conversion. Association Policies DICOM Storage SCU initiates associations but does not accept associations. DICOM Storage SCU allows two (configurable) SCU instances simultaneously. Asynchronous mode is not supported. All operations are performed synchronously. The Implementation Class UID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8 and the Implementation Version Name is fo-dicom 4.x.x .

HL7 MLLP Listener The HL7 listener adheres to the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) which accepts Health Level 7 messages via TCP/IP connections at port 2575 (default). The Informatics Gateway provides basic syntax validation based on HL7-dotnetcore toolkit. All validated messages are stored regardless of the message types. Communication The Informatics Gateway allows concurrent connections for the HL7 listener and allows multiple messages to be transmitted in a single connection or in a single command. Messages received are immediately assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. Configurations The HL7 listener can be configured in the appsettings.json file. Refer to Configuration for additional details. Acknowledgement Mode The listener supports the acknowledgment mode dictated in the MSH.15 field. If no value is specified, the listener defaults to the configuration option sendAck . Supported Character Sets The HL7 listener supports Unicode UTF8 or any 8-bit character sets."

Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices. b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr. 5. Scope of License. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not ï¿½ work around any technical limitations in the software; ï¿½ reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software; ï¿½ remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; ï¿½ use the software in any way that is against the law; or ï¿½ share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party. 6. Export Restrictions. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting. ï¿½ 7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is ï¿½as is,ï¿½ we may not provide support services for it. 8. Entire Agreement. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services. 9. Applicable Law.ï¿½ If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. 10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software. c) Germany and Austria. (i)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software. (ii)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence 11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ï¿½AS-IS.ï¿½ YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 12. Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below. 1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications. 2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software. 3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS. a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.

Right to Use and Distribute. ï¿½ You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software. ï¿½ Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications. ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must ï¿½ use the Distributable Code in your applications and not as a standalone distribution; ï¿½ require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement; and ï¿½ indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneysï¿½ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified Distributable Code. iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not ï¿½ use Microsoftï¿½s trademarks in your applicationsï¿½ names or in a way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or ï¿½ modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An ï¿½Excluded Licenseï¿½ is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it. 4. DATA. a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services.ï¿½ You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation.ï¿½ There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoftï¿½s privacy statement.

Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software. c) Germany and Austria. (i)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software. (ii)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence 11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ï¿½AS-IS.ï¿½ YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.

Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software. c) Germany and Austria. (i)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software. (ii)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence 11. Disclaimer of Warranty. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ï¿½AS-IS.ï¿½ YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 12. Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

MIG uses standard protocols like DICOM and FHIR. It stores studies and resources from the medical record system as payloads. It then notifies the rest of the MONAI Deploy system, specifically the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager, that data is ready to be processed. After inference completes, MIG receives notifications for exporting the results to the proper consumers, usually PACS or viewers for visualization, VNAs for storage, and EHRs (Electronic Healthcare Records). Services MIG contains the following standard protocols for communicating with medical devices: DICOM SCP : C-ECHO, C-STORE DICOM SCU : C-STORE HL7 Server : A HL7 MLLP listener. ACR DSI API : The American College of Radiology’s Data Science Institute API DICOMweb client : QIDO-RS, WADO-RS, STOW-RS FHIR client : GET [!Note] The ACR DSI API uses the DICOMweb client and FHIR client. DICOM SCP The DICOM SCP Service accepts standard DICOM C-ECHO and C-STORE commands, which receive DICOM instances for processing. In addition, the Informatics Gateway groups received DICOM instances by the study or series based on the configuration. Once DICOM instances are grouped, they are assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. DICOM SCU The DICOM SCU Service enables users to export application-generated DICOM results to external DICOM devices. It subscribes to the md.export.request.monaiscu events generated by the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager and then exports the data to user-configured DICOM destination(s). Note DICOM instances are sent as-is; no codec conversion is done as part of the SCU process. See the DICOM Interface SCU section for more information. DICOMWeb STOW-RS The DICOMWeb STOW-RS Service allows users to trigger a new workflow request by uploading a DICOM dataset. The entire DICOM dataset is assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. It provides options to trigger a workflow with or without specifying a workflow ID/name. See the DICOMWeb STOW-RS section for more information. HL7 MLLP Server The HL7 MLLP Server accepts Health Level 7 messages via the MLLP (Minimal Lower Layer Protocol). The received messages are validated and assembled into a payload for the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager to consume. ACR DSI API The ACR DSI API allows users to trigger inference requests via RESTful calls, utilizing DICOMweb and FHIR to retrieve data specified in the request. Upon data retrieval, the Informatics Gateway uploads the data to the shared storage and generates an md.workflow.request event, which notifies the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager for processing. DICOMweb Export A DICOMweb export agent can export any user-generated DICOM content to configured DICOM destinations. The agent subscribes to the md.export.request.monaidicomweb events generated by the MONAI Deploy Workflow Manager and then exports the data to user-configured DICOMweb destination(s)."

Any provided values that are invalid or missing may cause the service to crash. Note If the Informatics Gateway is running with Kubernetes/Helm and is reporting the CrashLoopBack error, it may be indicating a startup error due to misconfiguration, simply run kubectl logs <name-of-dicom-adapter-pod> to review the validation errors. Logging Informatics Gateway, by default, is configured to writes all logs to the console as well as text files. The behaviors may be changed in the nlog.config file. Logs files are stored in the logs/ directory where the Informatics Gateway executable is stored. To change the location, modify the logDir variable defined in the nlog.config file. Informaitcs Gateway also supports shipping logs to LogStash, ELK using the Network target provided by NLog . To enable this feature, simply set the environment variable LOGSTASH_URL to the TCP endpoint of LogStash. E.g. LOGSTASH_URL=tcp://my-logstash-ip:5000 . To use other logging services, refer to NLog Config . Note If the Informatics Gateway is running inside a Docker container, additional configuration may be required to limit the size to prevent logs from filling up storage space. Refer to the Docker documentation for additional information."

For a complete reference of the appsettings.json file, refer to the Configuration Schema . The second command passes the endpoint for the Informatics Gateway RESTful API to mig-cli . Note To see available commands, simply execute mig-cli or mig-cli.exe . Refer to CLI for complete reference. Database Configuration The Informatics Gateway supports the following database systems: SQLite (default) MongoDB SQLite (default) SQLite is a lite weight, full-featured SQL database engine and is the default database engine used by the Informatics Gateway. With SQLite, the Informatics Gateway works out of the box without any external database service dependencies or configuration. The default configuration maps the database file mig.db in the /database directory. { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"Type\": \"sqlite\", \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"Data Source=/database/mig.db\" } } MongoDB For enterprise installations, MongoDB is the recommended database solution. To switch from SQLite to MongoDB, edit the appsettings.json file, and change the ConnectionStrings section to the following with the correct username, password, IP address/hostname, and port. { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"Type\": \"mongodb\", \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"mongodb://username:password@IP:port\", \"DatabaseName\": \"InformaticsGateway\" } } Other Database Systems Extending the Informatics Gateway to support other database systems can be done with a few steps. If the database system is supported by Microsoft Entity Framework , then it can be added to the existing project . For other database systems that are not listed in the link above, simply implement the Repository APIs , update the Database Manager to support the new database type and optionally, implement the IDabaseMigrationManager . Storage Consideration & Configuration The Informatics Gateway operates on two storage locations. In the first location, the incoming data for data grouping is temporarily stored. In the second location, the Informatics Gateway uploads grouped datasets to final storage shared by other MONAI Deploy sub-systems. Temporary Storage of Incoming Dataset By default, the temporary storage location is set to use Disk and stores any incoming files inside /payloads . This can be modified to user a different location, such as Memory or a different path. To change the temporary storage path, locate the InformaticsGateway>storage>localTemporaryStoragePath property in the appsettings.json file and modify it. Note You will need to calculate the required temporary storage based on the number of studies and the size of each study. Also, consider changing the AE Title timeout if the AE Title needs to wait a long time before assembling and uploading the payload for final storage. Note Before running the Informatics Gateway, adjust the values of watermarkPercent and reserveSpaceGB based on the expected number of studies and size of each study. The suggested value for reserveSpaceGB is 2x to 3x the size of a single study multiplied by the number of configured AE Titles. Storage Service Informatics Gateway includes MinIO as the default storage service provider. To integrate with another storage service provider, please refer to the Data Storage section of the SRS. Download and install MinIO by following the quickstart guide . Once MinIO is installed and configured, modify the storage configuration to enable communication between the Informatics Gateway and MinIO. Locate the storage section of the configuration in appsettings.json : { \"ConnectionStrings\": { \"InformaticsGatewayDatabase\": \"Data Source=migdev.db\" }, \"InformaticsGateway\": { \"dicom\": { ... }, \"storage\": { \"localTemporaryStoragePath\": \"/payloads\", # path to store incoming data before uploading to the storage service \"remoteTemporaryStoragePath\": \"/incoming\", # the path on the \"temporaryBucketName\" where the data is uploaded to before payload assembly \"bucketName\": \"monaideploy\", # name of the bucket for storing payloads \"temporaryBucketName\": \"monaideploy\", # name of the bucket for temporarily storing incoming data before payload is assembled \"serviceAssemblyName\": \"Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIO.MinIoStorageService, Monai.Deploy.Storage.MinIO\", # the fully qualified assembly name for the storage service to use \"watermarkPercent\": 75, # a percentage value that indicates when the system shall stop receiving or downloading data. Disk space is calculated based on the path defined in \"localTemporaryStoragePath\" \"reserveSpaceGB\": 5, # minimum disk space required and reserved for the Informatics Gateway \"settings\": { # settings for the storage library: default to minio \"endpoint\": \"localhost:9000\", # MinIO server IP and port number \"accessKey\": \"admin\", # username/access key \"accessToken\": \"password\", # password/access token \"securedConnection\": false, # enable secured connection to minio? \"region\": \"local\", # storatge region \"createBuckets\": \"monaideploy\" # buckets to be created on startup if not already exists } }, ... } } Note Update the createBuckets configuration if you would like to have the Informatics Gateway create the storage buckets on startup. Otherwise, leave it blank. To create multiple buckets, separate each bucket name with comma. Install the Storage Plug-in As shown above, the default plug-in configured is MinIO and is ready to use. To use other storage plug-in, refer to MONAI Deploy Storage for available plug-ins or bring your own plug-in. To install a new storage plug-in, unzip the files to the plug-ins directory in your home directory: Linux: ~/.mig/plug-ins Windows: C:\\Users\\[username]\\.mig\\plug-ins Note If a plug-in other than MinIO is used, update the storageService parameter in the appsettings.json file. Message broker The Informatics Gateway communicates with other MONAI Deploy components through a message broker. The default messaging service included is provided by RabbitMQ . To integrate with another storage service provider, refer to the Data Storage section of the SRS. To use the default messaging service, download and install RabbitMQ by following the Get Started page. The Informatics Gateway publishes all messages to an exchange under the specified virtual host . Before launching Informatics Gateway, update the appsettings.json file to configure the publisher and subscriber settings. { \"InformaticsGateway\": { \"messaging\": { \"publisherServiceAssemblyName\":\"Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQMessagePublisherService, Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ\", \"publisherSettings\": { \"endpoint\": \"localhost\", \"username\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\", \"virtualHost\": \"monaideploy\", \"exchange\": \"monaideploy\" }, \"subscriberServiceAssemblyName\":\"Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ.RabbitMQMessageSubscriberService, Monai.Deploy.Messaging.RabbitMQ\", \"subscriberSettings\": { \"endpoint\": \"localhost\", \"username\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\", \"virtualHost\": \"monaideploy\", \"exchange\": \"monaideploy\", \"exportRequestQueue\": \"export_tasks\" } }, } } Install the Messaging Plug-in As shown above, the default plug-in configured is RabbitMQ and is ready to use. To use other plug-in, refer to MONAI Deploy Messaging for available plug-ins. To install a new messaging plug-in, unzip the files to the plug-ins directory in your home directory: Linux: ~/.mig/plug-ins Windows: C:\\Users\\[username]\\.mig\\plug-ins Note If a plug-in other than Rabbit is used, update the publisherServiceAssemblyName and subscriberServiceAssemblyName parameters in the appsettings.json file. Start/Stop Informatics Gateway To start or stop the Informatics Gateway, update the value of the DockerImagePrefix parameter in the appsettings.json file with the repository name of the Docker image (the default value is shown below): { ..., \"Cli\": { \"DockerImagePrefix\": \"ghcr.io/project-monai/monai-deploy-informatics-gateway\" } } Lastly, use one of the following commands to start or stop the Informatics Gateway: mig-cli start mig-cli stop Enable Incoming Associations The next step is to configure the Informatics Gateway to enable receiving of DICOM instances from external DICOM devices. Configure a listening AE Title to receive instances: mig-cli aet add -a BrainAET -grouping 0020,000E, -t 30 The command creates a new listening AE Title with AE Title BrainAET . The listening AE Title will group instances by the Series Instance UID (0020,000E) with a timeout value of 30 seconds. Note -grouping is optional, with a default value of 0020,000D. -t is optional, with a default value of 5 seconds. For complete reference, refer to the Config API . Enable the receiving of DICOM instances from external DICOM devices: mig-cli src add -n PACS-LA -a PACSLA001 --h 20.10.30.55 The above command tells the Informatics Gateway to accept instances from AE Title PACSLA001 at IP 20.10.30.55 and port 104 . Note By default, Informatics Gateway blocks all unknown sources. To allow all unknown sources, set the dicom>scp>rejectUnknownSources parameter to false in the appsettings.json file. Warning The Informatics Gateway validates both the source IP address and AE Title when rejectUnknownSources is set to true . When the Informatics Gateway is running in a container and data is coming from the localhost, the IP address may not be the same as the host IP address. In this case, open the log file and locate the association that failed; the log should indicate the correct IP address under Remote host . Export Processed Results If exporting via DIMSE is required, add a DICOM destination: mig-cli dst add -a WORKSTATION1 -h 100.200.10.20 -p 104 The command adds a DICOM export destination with AE Title WORKSTATION1 at IP 100.200.10.20 and port 104 . Logging See schema page for additional information on logging."
