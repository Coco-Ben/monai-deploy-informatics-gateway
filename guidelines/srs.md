## Design

### DICOM SCP Service

![DICOM SCP Sequence Diagram](diagrams/mig-scp.png)

MIG's (the system) Storage SCP provides DICOM C-ECHO and C-STORE services to interface with other DICOM devices, such as PACS. In addition, the system allows users to configure one or more AE Titles where each AET allows one or more concurrent incoming associations at a given time. Associations are rejected if more than configured associations are in session.

A unique identifier (UUID) is generated for data flow correlation purposes upon accepting an incoming association. This UUID is also used when uploading to the MWM.

If enabled, the AET verifies the calling AET by validating the source IP address and the calling AE Title against allowed sources.

If enabled, the AET verifies the calling AET by validating the source IP address and the calling AE Title against allowed sources.

The C-ECHO (verification) service can be enabled or disabled based on configuration.

#### Association Policies

- MIG SCP AET accepts associations but does not initiate associations.
- MIG Storage SCP, by default, accepts up `25` (configurable) concurrent associations.
- MIG Storage SCP accepts associations when storage space usage is less than the configured watermark, and the available storage space is above the configured reserved storage size.
- Asynchronous mode is not supported. All operations are performed synchronously.
- The Implementation Class UID is `1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8` and the Implementation Version Name is `fo-dicom {major}.{minor}.{build}`.

#### Security Profiles

MIG Storage SCP does not conform to any defined DICOM Security Profiles.
The product is assumed to be used within a secured environment that uses a Firewall, Router Protection, VPN, etc.

MIG Storage SCP service can be configured to accept all incoming association requests or check against an allowed AET and its:

- Called AE Title
- Calling AE Title
- Calling IP Address

#### Retry Logic

The system would retry the following actions upon failure. Values can be overridden in the configuration file.

| Action       | Retry Delay             | Maximum Retries |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Save to disk | Sliding: 250ms - 1000ms | 3               |
| Notify MWM   | Sliding: 250ms - 1000ms | 3               |

### DICOM SCU Service

![Export Sequence Diagram](diagrams/mig-export.png)

MIG's (the system) Storage SCU provides DICOM Storage Service to interface with other medical devices, such as PACS, to export any DICOM artifacts produced by the applications.

The users can configure the SCU AE Title in the configuration file.

MIG DICOM Storage SCU initiates a push of DICOM objects or a C-STORE request to the Remote DICOM Storage SCP. The system shall allow multiple Remote (destination) SCPs to be configured.

Each Remote DICOM Storage SCP must be uniquely named so MWM sinks can reference them.

C-STORE SCU stops all processing when storage space usage is less than the configured watermark, and the available storage space is above the configured reserved storage size.

#### SOP Classes (Transfer) Supported & Transfer Syntax

The DICOM Store SCU service shall support all SOP Classes of the Storage Service Class.

The DICOM Store SCU service shall transfer a DICOM object using stored Transfer Syntax without the support of compression, decompression, or Transfer Syntax conversion.

#### Association Policies

- MIG DICOM Storage SCU initiates associations but does not accept associations.
- MIG DICOM Storage SCU allows, by default, 2 (configurable) SCU instances simultaneously.
- Asynchronous mode is not supported. Instead, all operations are performed synchronously.
- The Implementation Class UID is `1.3.6.1.4.1.30071.8` and the Implementation Version Name is `fo-dicom {major}.{minor}.{build}`.

#### Security Profiles

Not applicable.

#### Retry Logic

The system would retry the following actions upon failure. Values can be overridden in the configuration file.

| Action | Retry Delay             | Maximum Retries |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Export | Sliding: 250ms - 1000ms | 3               |

### DICOMweb Client

The DICOMweb client enables querying, retrieving, and storing of DICOM objects to DICOMweb enabled services.

#### WADO Client APIs

WADO (Web Access to DICOM Objects) client contains a set of APIs defined by the DICOM standard. MIG supports the following WADO APIs:

- `GET /studies/{study}` Retrieve Study
- `GET /studies/{study}/metadata` Retrieve Study metadata
- `GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}` Retrieve Series
- `GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/metadata` Retrieve Series metadata
- `GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}` Retrieve Instance
- `GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/metadata` Retrieve Instance metadata
- `GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/bulkdata/{bulkdata}` Retrieve Bulkdata

#### QIDO Client APIs

QIDO (Query based on ID for DICOM Objects) client contains a set of APIs defined by the DICOM standard, and MIG supports the following QIDO APIs:

- `GET /studies` Search for Studies

#### STOW Client APIs

STOW (Store Over the WEb) client enables storing DICOM instances to a DICOMweb server.
MIG supports the following STOW APIs:

- `POST /studies` Store instances
- `POST /studies/{study}` Store instances

#### Retry Logic

The DICOMweb client does not perform any retries. However, the Data Retrieval component that utilizes the DICOMweb client would handle retries.

| Action | Retry Delay | Maximum Retries |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| \*     | None        | None            |

---

### FHIR Client

MIG (the system) provides an FHIR client to exchange FHIR resources with FHIR enabled services.

To retrieve an FHIR resource, users must specify the type and ID of a resource.
The system retrieves FHIR resources, by default, in JSON format. However, the user may modify the request body to instruct Informatics Gateway to retrieve FHIR resources in XML format.

MIG also allows users to export FHIR resources to designated FHIR services.

_Limitations_: The FHIR client works in conjunction with ACR API. To retrieve or export any FHIR resources, users must explicitly specify the endpoints of each FHIR service.

#### Retry Logic

The FHIR client does not perform any retries. However, the Data Retrieval component that utilizes the FHIR client would handle retries.

| Action | Retry Delay | Maximum Retries |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| \*     | None        | None            |

---

### Logging

MONAI Deploy Informatics Gateway logs all its actions and associates each activity with a unique identifier for traceability.

Different log levels are used and are defined in [LogLevel Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loglevel).

The entire DIMSE dataset (for SCP) may be logged, but no anonymization would be performed, and therefore this feature is, by default, disabled.

---

### ACR-DSI API (future)

![ACR Sequence Diagram](diagrams/mig-acr.png)

The [ACR-DSI API](https://www.acrdsi.org/-/media/DSI/Files/ACR-DSI-Model-API.pdf) is proposed by the American College of Radiology's Data Science Institute.  The implementation of the API specs may be different from the original proposal. Please refer to the API documentation for details.

The transaction ID supplied in the API call is used when notifying MWM of the dataset for data flow trace purposes. Therefore, the transaction ID must be unique.

The following APIs are supported to interact with the ACR-DSI API:

#### Inference API

Please refer to [User Guide](../docs/api/rest/inference.md) for complete API reference.
